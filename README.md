# Overview

The idea of this project is to create a better notification system for TTC (Toronto Transit Comission) bus arrivals, motivated by:

- People (me) missing TTC buses too many times by relying on various apps and websites that provide their own way of tracking buses and (poorly) informing you on live arrival times.
- A motivation to learn to build applications backend-to-frontend and everything in between, since as a student, all I've known is front-end internships and am generally inexperienced as a SWE (especially outside a JS framework)

General to-do:

- [ ] Incrementally improve README(s), not dump it all at the end, to build good documentation writing skills and make a habit of periodically updating/reflecting on code, and to not forget code I wrote two months ago.
- [ ] Learn about APIs in general and learn how to use it for the project like user creation
- [ ] Decide if i am actually gonna code a webpage or two for this

Currently working/going to work on:

- [ ] Static route data assurance, ensuring open-sourced TTC data is always up to date
- [ ] Processing route data to get an exhaustive and unique collection of bus routes that maintain stop order and details
- [ ] Learning about and developing APIs for user creation and serving many kinds
